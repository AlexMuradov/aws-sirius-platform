# Sirius: AI-Powered Observability Tool

## Overview

Sirius is an advanced AI-powered observability tool designed to streamline error detection, suggestion of fixes, and automated code changes in your software repositories. Powered by state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, Sirius revolutionizes the way developers handle errors and maintain code quality.

## Features

### Error Detection

Sirius actively monitors your software repositories and analyzes the terminal output to detect errors, exceptions, and bugs in real-time. By intelligently parsing log messages and stack traces, Sirius quickly identifies potential issues that require attention.

### Suggestion of Fixes

Once an error is detected, Sirius doesn't just stop there! It goes the extra mile by suggesting possible fixes for common errors based on patterns it has learned from vast amounts of code repositories. These intelligent suggestions are designed to save you time and effort in resolving issues.

### Automated Code Changes

Sirius takes error handling to the next level by automatically implementing the suggested fixes directly into your codebase. With your approval, Sirius commits and pushes the necessary code changes, freeing up developers to focus on more critical tasks.

### Seamless Integration

Sirius integrates effortlessly with your existing version control systems, such as Git, GitHub, or GitLab. This ensures a smooth onboarding process, allowing you to start leveraging its capabilities without disrupting your workflow.

## How It Works

1. **Error Detection**: Sirius continuously monitors your repositories, analyzing the terminal output and identifying potential errors based on well-defined patterns.

2. **Suggestion of Fixes**: Once an error is detected, Sirius employs advanced NLP techniques to analyze the error message, stack traces, and relevant code context to generate intelligent fix suggestions.

3. **Automated Code Changes**: With your approval, Sirius automatically implements the suggested fixes directly into your codebase using pull requests or merge requests, saving valuable developer time.

4. **Feedback Loop**: Sirius learns from every interaction, becoming smarter and more accurate in error detection and fix suggestions over time.

## Getting Started

To start using Sirius, follow these simple steps:

1. **Installation**: Install Sirius either as a standalone application or integrate it into your existing observability infrastructure.

2. **Configure Repositories**: Add the repositories you want Sirius to monitor for errors and automated fixes.

3. **API Access**: Obtain the necessary API access for seamless integration with your version control system.

4. **Sit Back and Relax**: Let Sirius handle the heavy lifting! Enjoy improved error detection, smarter fix suggestions, and automated code changes with minimal effort.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
